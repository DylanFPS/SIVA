## Want to invite the bots?

### Invite SIVA
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=320942091049893888&scope=bot&permissions=8
  
**By default, this has the Administrator permission checked. Keep this if you're using the support system. If you're not, feel free to uncheck. It's still advised to keep it checked. If you don't want admin, [here's another invite link](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=320942091049893888&permissions=201682038&scope=bot).**
If you want support and refuse to give the bot the admin permission if it needs it, you won't get support. Period.

### What is SIVA-dev (bot)
It's the debugging copy of SIVA. It's only online when I am debugging new changes. Recommended to not use it, the invite here is mostly for my purposes. If you see this in SIVA-dev, donotfear.

### Permission rundown

For the secondary bot invite: `https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=320942091049893888&permissions=201682038&scope=bot` there's a few permissions checked. Here's a rundown of what they all do.

Manage {blank}: admin module.

Kick/Ban members: what else do you think this is for? (moderation lol)

Use external emojis: for a wHO_PENG emoji on the ping command and future commands.

Embed Links: REQUIRED. all commands are embeds and therefore require this.

Send/Read Messages: obvious.
